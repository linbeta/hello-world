# hello-world
This is my first tutorial repository on Github.

I am trying to complete the Github Hello World tutorial.

I am a programming begginer based in Taipei, Taiwan.
I currently started a web developer's online course and a pyton online course which will teach how to build a chatbot to analyse stock investments.

Wish me good luck and I look forward to collaborating with you guys and creating something interesting projects in the near future!
